# VM

We'll be using a VM for development purposes to mitigate any development environment differences between team members.

1. Obtain a license (free for CSE students) and download Vmware Fusion Pro [here](https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx?ws=7c113c30-5d8b-de11-8cd1-0030487d8897)

2. Download and run the prebuilt VM available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hkwwbvpvqee6tvo/COMP9323.ova?dl=0)

# Frontend

Skeleton for fetching data from JSON db file served via an express server.

1. In /frontend run `yarn install` then `yarn dev`
2. In /frontend-dev-server run `yarn install` then `yarn server`

Frontend should be running on http://localhost:3000
frontend-dev-server should be running on http://localhost:3001

## frontend-dev-server endpoints
GET / - returns JSON object with contents of frontend-dev-server/db.json

# Backend TBA
